                <p>
                    <p>As with any service-oriented business, dry cleaners can achieve success by adhering to a few simple principles: </p>
                </p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer retention costs less than customer acquisition.</li>
                        <li>Retaining even a small increased percentage of your customers will significantly improve your bottom line.</li>
                        <li>Businesses with effective customer retention programs are more profitable than those without them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <p>Traditionally, dry cleaners have sought growth by:</p>
                </p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>opening new stores</li>
                        <li>offering additional services</li>
                        <li>price discounting</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <p>Each of these options aims to bring more traffic into your stores by an externally focused approach. While these external strategies should by no means be ignored, they should no longer be the preferred, go-to options.</p>
                    <p>Dry cleaners need to become more internally focused and find ways to keep more of their existing customers. According to a study by two Harvard professors of marketing, companies can increase profits by 100% if they retain as few as
                        5% more of their current customers than are presently being retained. </p>
                </p>
                <h3><p>How This Works</p>
</h3>
                <p>
                    <p>Assume that a “heavy user” visits once a week and spends $40 per visit. This equates to $160+ per month. While the heavy users may be a small portion of your total customers, losing one might require several more to make up the loss.</p>
                    <p>Most dry cleaners find that a majority of their business comes from 20%–30% of their customers. A tool that can create habits, change behavior, and differentiate a business from its competitors, customer retention programs can prevent
                        customers from leaving or even get them back.</p>
                    <p>Once customers join a retention program, they tend to increase their spending by an average of 27%. That spike in spending is pure growth, without the high cost of acquiring new customers. When you can’t acquire many new customers,
                        but you still want to grow, existing customers must spend more. (Remember Principle 1?) When all the fundamentals are in place, a customer retention program works by building (or enhancing) customer perception of your service’s
                        value in relation to the money charged. Without providing a quality service, you’re just trying to trap the customer, and it won’t work for long.</p>
                </p>
                <h3><p>Winning the Hearts, Minds, and Wallets of Today&#39;s Customers</p>
</h3>
                <p>
                    <p>Customer loyalty requires your business to have a branded image complete with a logo and distinctive colors so customers can immediately identify the quality service you’re providing. Use these colors and logos on everything you can—both
                        in and outside of your stores.</p>
                    <p>There’s no such thing as a standard program. Try providing something of value in addition to exceptionally good service in exchange for more frequent patronage of your stores.</p>
                    <p>At American Express, membership indeed has its privileges for both the company and its customers. Participants in the card’s loyalty program spend four times more than a customer who is not enrolled so don’t confuse a repeat customer
                        with a loyal one. Habit alone can cause some customers to stick around because of laziness or convenience.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, <em>training customers to use you exclusively and more frequently is not the same as making them happy</em>. Making them happy requires quality of service, which is the main intent of their patronage. From there, you will
                        receive referrals. When loyal customers refer family and friends to your business, marketing costs are reduced.</p>
                    <p>With loyalty comes responsibility. In addition to quality cleaning, customers want problem resolution that is quick and more than fair. Whether it’s lost or damaged clothes or an order not ready on time, give them even greater compensation
                        than the damages they’ve sustained. That’s the customer’s point of view, and that’s what it takes to make that customer a raving fan of your cleaners. If you’re unwilling to go to these lengths to win customers’ loyalty, then there’s
                        no need to consider a customer retention program.</p>
                    <p>A good P.O.S. system is capable not only of maintaining a customer database but also recording the frequency of visits and total expenditures. Using this kind of criteria to build reward programs will add value to your service and
                        differentiate it from your competitors.</p>
                    <p>So, start targeting your valuable customers with meaningful rewards and watch their spending rise. </p>
